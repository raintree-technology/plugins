# Add a web source to this session

The user wants to add a source to docpull's local Markdown index so it's searchable later via `/web-search` (or directly via the `grep_docs` MCP tool). This command is the web/source-facing name for the older `/docs-add` workflow.

User input: **$ARGUMENTS**

## How to handle the input

Inspect `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty or missing.** Reply with a one-line usage hint and stop:
   `Usage: /web-add <alias>, /web-add <https-url>, or /web-add <name> <https-url>. Run /web-list to see what's already cached.`

2. **One token, no URL scheme** (e.g. `react`, `fastapi`).
   - Treat as a built-in alias. Call `ensure_docs(source="<alias>")`. The default `rag` profile is right for most cases - only override if the user mentioned a specific profile.
   - If the alias is unknown, the tool will return an error listing available aliases. In that case call `list_sources()` and suggest the closest match by edit distance, or recommend running `/web-add <name> <url>` with the source URL.

3. **One token, an HTTPS URL** (starts with `https://`).
   - Call `list_sources()` first so you can detect both built-in aliases and user-defined aliases, including sources that have not been fetched yet.
   - Auto-derive an alias name from the hostname:
     1. Take the hostname.
     2. Strip a leading `docs.` or `www.` if present.
     3. Take the first dot-separated label.
     4. Lowercase it.
     5. Examples: `https://docs.fastapi.tiangolo.com` -> `fastapi`; `https://nextjs.org/docs` -> `nextjs`; `https://example.com/blog` -> `example`.
   - If the derived name already appears in `list_sources()`, tell the user and suggest the explicit `/web-add <name> <url>` form so they pick a unique name. Do not call `add_source` for a derived name that already exists.
   - Otherwise call `add_source(name=<derived>, url=<url>)` to register, then `ensure_docs(source=<derived>)` to fetch.

4. **Two tokens, second is an HTTPS URL** (`<name> <url>`).
   - Validate the name is a sensible alias (alnum + `_ . -`, <=128 chars). If not, ask for a cleaner name.
   - Call `add_source(name=<name>, url=<url>)`. This intentionally updates an existing user-defined alias with the same name. If it returns "is a builtin source", tell the user that `add_source` refuses to shadow builtins by default. Do not pass `force=true` without explicit user consent.
   - Then call `ensure_docs(source=<name>)` to fetch.

## After it succeeds

Report a one-line summary:
- Source name (alias used).
- Pages fetched (from the `ensure_docs` response - pages_fetched / pages_skipped / pages_failed).
- Suggest the next step: `/web-search <pattern> [source]` or ask the agent to grep for something specific.

## After it fails

Show the error in plain language. Common cases:
- **Unknown built-in alias** -> list a few suggestions from `list_sources`.
- **URL rejected** (HTTP, localhost, private IP) -> tell the user docpull is HTTPS-only by design and won't fetch internal hosts; suggest a public source URL.
- **`add_source` refused a builtin** -> tell the user the alias collides with a built-in; pick a different name.
- **Network / 4xx / 5xx during `ensure_docs`** -> show the URL and status code; suggest checking network, the URL itself, or trying a different public path.

Do not use any tools beyond the ones listed in `allowed-tools`. Do not send filler messages while the fetch is running - let the tool output speak for itself.
