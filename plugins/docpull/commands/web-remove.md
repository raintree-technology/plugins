# Remove a web source

The user wants to remove a previously-added source. By default this also deletes cached Markdown to free disk and avoid stale answers.

User input: **$ARGUMENTS**

## How to handle the input

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` as:

- **First token = source alias** (the alias to remove).
- **Optional `--keep-cache` flag** = remove the alias from the user registry but leave the cached `.md` files on disk.

If empty: reply `Usage: /web-remove <source> [--keep-cache]. Run /web-list to see what's cached.` and stop.

## Workflow

1. **Default (no flag): remove alias AND delete cache.**
   Call `remove_source(name=<source>, delete_cache=true)`. The MCP tool refuses to remove builtins (`react`, `nextjs`, etc.) - pass that error through to the user with the suggestion in step 3.

2. **`--keep-cache` flag: remove alias only.**
   Call `remove_source(name=<source>, delete_cache=false)`. The cached Markdown stays; `/web-search <source>` will keep working until the user runs this without the flag.

3. **If the tool returns "is a builtin source"**:
   Tell the user that builtins can't be removed but they can be shadowed with a custom URL via `/web-add` (or by editing `sources.yaml` directly).

4. **If the tool returns the no-op response** (no user source AND no cache to delete): tell the user there was nothing to remove. Don't error.

## Output

One line: confirm what was removed (alias only, cache only, both, or nothing). The MCP tool's response is already specific - relay it.

## Don't

- Don't run `rm -rf` via Bash; the MCP tool's `delete_cache=true` does the safe path-validated deletion.
- Don't call this on builtins thinking force will help - there's no force flag for removal by design.
