# Refresh a cached web source

Force-refetch a source that's already cached. The default `ensure_docs` honors a 7-day cache; this command bypasses it.

User input: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Workflow

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` as a single source alias. If empty: reply `Usage: /web-refresh <source>. Run /web-list to see what's cached.` and stop.

2. Call `ensure_docs(source=<source>, force=true)`. The tool will re-crawl the source (using whatever URL the alias resolves to) and overwrite the cached `.md` files in place.

3. **If the alias is unknown**: pass through the tool's error. Suggest `/web-add <source>` if it's a built-in or `/web-add <name> <url>` if not.

4. After success, report a one-line summary using the tool's response (pages fetched / skipped / failed).

## When to use this vs `/web-add`

- `/web-add <name>` - first time fetching, or when the cache is fresh and you want to use it.
- `/web-refresh <name>` - already cached but you want the latest. Don't run this every time you search; the conditional-GET cache makes it cheap, but it still hits the network for every page.

## Don't

- Don't loop this across all cached sources unprompted. If the user wants a global refresh, ask first.
- Don't pass `force=true` to `ensure_docs` from any other command - that's what this command is for.
