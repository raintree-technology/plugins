description: Use the docpull MCP tools (list_indexed, ensure_docs, grep_docs, read_doc, fetch_url) to ground answers in real web/source material when the user asks about a specific library, framework, API, vendor, product page, website, or public source URL. Activate on questions like "how do I X in [library]", "what's the API for [framework].[method]", "summarize this site/source", "show me what [vendor] says about Y", or when a user pastes a documentation/source URL.

# docpull research

Ground library/framework, API, vendor, product, and website answers in fetched source material instead of training-data recall. The cost of one `grep_docs` call is ~50 ms; the cost of giving a confidently wrong answer about a fast-moving source is much higher.

## When to use this skill

**Activate when** the user's question names a specific library, framework, SDK, API surface, vendor, product page, or website - especially:

- **Fast-moving libraries** where training-data drift is likely: Next.js (App Router), Pydantic v2, LangChain, FastAPI, Anthropic SDK, OpenAI SDK, Drizzle, Prisma, Tailwind v4+, Vercel AI SDK.
- **Version-specific questions** ("how does X work in [library] v[N]").
- **Pasted documentation, blog, vendor, product, or source URLs** the user wants explained or referenced.
- **Code the user is actively writing** against a library, where wrong signatures will cost them debugging time.

**Do NOT activate for**:

- General programming questions ("what's a closure", "explain async/await").
- The user's own codebase — that's what Read/Grep are for.
- Highly stable, well-known stdlib APIs (Python `os`, JavaScript `Array.prototype`).
- Clarifying questions where the answer is trivial from context.

## Workflow

### 1. Check what's already cached

Always start with `list_indexed`. It's free and tells you which libraries you can search immediately without fetching.

```
list_indexed() → ["fastapi (3d ago)", "react (12h ago)", ...]
```

### 2. If the source/library is cached -> search it

Use `grep_docs` with a focused regex. The source is already on disk, so this is a local search:

```
grep_docs(library="fastapi", pattern="dependency injection", limit=10, context=2)
```

If you want more context around a hit, use `read_doc(library, path, line_start, line_end)`.

### 3. If the source/library is NOT cached -> decide whether to fetch

- **Built-in alias** (the source appears in `list_sources()`): call `ensure_docs(source="<alias>")`. This crawls and indexes the whole source. ~10-30s for typical sites.
- **Pasted documentation or source URL**: call `fetch_url(url=...)` if you only need one static/server-rendered page. For a whole source site you don't have an alias for, tell the user to run `/web-add <URL>` (or the older `/docs-add <URL>` alias) so docpull can register and crawl it; the MCP `fetch_url` is single-page only.
- **No alias, user didn't paste a URL**: ask the user once whether they'd like to add the source, and what URL should be used. Don't fetch speculatively.

### 4. Quote with attribution

When you cite fetched content, include the source path returned by `grep_docs` / `read_doc` so the user can verify. Example: "Per `fastapi/tutorial/dependencies.md:42`, dependencies declared with `Depends()` are resolved per-request..."

### 5. Don't over-fetch

- Don't call `ensure_docs` for libraries the user didn't ask about ("while we're here, let me also fetch...").
- Don't crawl the same source twice in one session - `list_indexed` will tell you it's there.
- If `grep_docs` returns nothing useful, broaden the regex once before suggesting the user add more source material.

## Built-in aliases

These are pre-configured and resolvable by `ensure_docs(source=...)` without setup: `react`, `nextjs`, `tailwindcss`, `vite`, `hono`, `fastapi`, `express`, `anthropic`, `openai`, `langchain`, `supabase`, `drizzle`, `prisma`. Run `list_sources()` for the current set.

## Failure modes

- **`ensure_docs` returns "unknown source"**: the alias isn't built-in. Either suggest `/web-add <URL>` or call `list_sources()` and propose a near match.
- **`grep_docs` returns empty**: the pattern is too narrow, or the fetched source doesn't cover the topic. Broaden once, then surface the gap to the user.
- **MCP server not responding**: tell the user to run `pip install 'docpull[mcp]'` and verify the plugin's MCP server is healthy. Fall back to answering from training data with an explicit caveat that fetched sources weren't available.

## Tone

When you've grounded an answer in fetched source material, say so once at the start of the answer ("Per the FastAPI docs..." or "Per the cached source..."). Don't pad every paragraph with attribution - one source citation up front plus inline file references is enough.
